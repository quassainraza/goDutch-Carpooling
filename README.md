GoDutch is an android application in which we enable people to connect and share rides.
 In this application we are implementing these high level features:.

## Application Features Right now

## How It Works



In the end we will have an Android application that will connect people within a radius that want to go to the same destination. They will be able to communicate in a chat room and in the chatroom there will be a chatbot to help them with smart replies(Quick Replies). Once the ride is started our application will guide them with the path and once the ride is finished the users sharing a ride can give reviews about other users with whom he/she shared a ride and once data is collected in our database we will perform pattern analysis on the data by using different data mining techniques.  The report will include the object oriented design artifacts and Software engineering approaches that will be used in the development. These artifacts are the product of the concrete discussion, study and research done by our team.
